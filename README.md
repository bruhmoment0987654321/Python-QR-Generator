# Python-QR-Generator
A cool qr code generator, definitely better than the online ones

I followed a tutorial online on how to make a QR code generator cause I don't like the online generators. 
I've tried to add features for putting an image into the background, but it's too complicated for what I'm trying to accomplish. 
I want something simple I can put a link, and generate a QR code.
